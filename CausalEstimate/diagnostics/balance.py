    """
    Standardized mean difference of a covariate between treated and control.

    Convention: the denominator is the pooled *unweighted* sample SD,
    sqrt((s1^2 + s0^2)/2), held fixed for both the unweighted and the weighted
    SMD so pre- and post-weighting values share a scale — the "standardize by
    the unadjusted sample" convention recommended by Stuart (2010) and used as
    the default in the cobalt R package. Note this deliberately differs from
    Austin & Stuart (2015), who use weighted variances post-weighting and a
    prevalence-based formula for binary covariates; binary covariates here go
    through the same numeric formula (sample variance ~ p(1-p)). A
    zero-variance covariate has no defined SMD: a warning is emitted and NaN
    returned.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    x : Covariate values (finite).
    A : Binary treatment assignment (1 treated, 0 control); each arm needs at
        least 2 observations.
    weights : Optional finite, nonnegative weights with positive sum per arm;
              when given, the mean difference is weighted (the denominator
              stays unweighted).
